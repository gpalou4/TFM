# TFM project notebook

This notebook is simple a file where I write everything I do during my master thesis, on a weekly basis, since I obtained the data to analyze.

#### October-November

Reading articles, defining the project, writing the project proposal (you can find it on Reports folder), making other collaborations analysis within the group, learning the quality control steps and EWAS analysis of the methylion data, and beginning to understand/propose the quality control for the gene expression array data.

#### Week 9-13 December 2019

We have already received approval by `dbGAP` to download the data. The next step is to know how exactly download it and where to find the gene expression array files, plus the metadata (phenotype). There are many many files, so that is not an easy task to do.

#### Week 16-20 December 2019
